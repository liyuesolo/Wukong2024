# WuKong Codebase

Depending on what you need you may choose to build the specific project by changing the CMakeLists.txt in the Project folder

Ideally basic simulation models such as,
-DiscreteShell, FEM2D/3D, EoLRods-
should have only the basic implementation such that they can be inherited whenever needed. 

### To-Dos
- [ ] Set up application base class
- [ ] Isohedral Tiling interface
- [ ] FEM2D
- [ ] IPC contact examples
- [ ] dynamics simulation
